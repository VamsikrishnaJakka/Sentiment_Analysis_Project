# Sentiment_Analysis_Project

The use case is for a company that receives a large volume of customer reviews on a regular basis. The company may want to analyze the sentiment of the reviews to gain insights into customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. By using a scalable pipeline with Spark to read and store the reviews in HDFS, the company can efficiently process and analyze the data. Additionally, scheduling the pipeline to run iteratively after each hour ensures that the analysis is up-to-date and can provide real-time feedback on customer satisfaction.
